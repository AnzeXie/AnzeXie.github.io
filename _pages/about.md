I am a computer science research assistant at UCSD, fortunately advised by [Prof. Hao Zhang](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~haozhang/). My research interests lie in the intersection of ML and systems. I aim to build an in-between layer that supports
real-world ML deployment by developing scalable ML algorithms and frameworks with good usability.

I obtained my MS. in CS at UCSD. Before coming to UCSD, I completed my undergraduate degree at UW-Madison major in CS, statistics, and applied mathematics. I spent a wonderful time at UW-Madison working with [Prof. Shivaram Venkataraman](https://shivaram.org/).
